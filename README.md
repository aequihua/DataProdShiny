# DataProdShiny
## Course Project - Developing Data Products
This repository contains the code of a demo shiny application based on the Central Limit Theorem, applied to the Exponential distribution. 

The live application is published in [here](https://aequihua.shinyapps.io/DataProdShiny/).

The application is rather simple, to use it there are just three parameters to play with (the lambda parameter of the exponential distribution, the number of simulations and the sample size per simulation).

The charts obtained help demonstrate how for bigger values of sample size (n) and/or a larger number of simulations, the density of the sample mean is normally distributed, and centered on the population mean.
